Abstract

   The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285]
   is to bridge the gap between network and applications by providing
   network related information to non-priviledged, application-level
   clients.  This allows applications to make informed decisions, for
   example when selecting a target host from a set of candidates.

   Therefore an ALTO Server provides network and cost maps to its
   clients.  However, those maps can be very large, and portions of
   those maps may change frequently (cost maps in particular).

   This draft presents a method to provide incremental updates for these
   maps.  The goal is to reduce the load on the ALTO Client and Server
   by transmitting just the updated portions of those maps.

Internet-Draft          ALTO Incremental Updates            October 2014


1.  Introduction

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol
   provides network related information to client applications so that
   clients may make informed decisions.  An ALTO Server provides network
   and cost maps, which may be very large and change very frequently.

   Instead of having the clients request for a new complete network map
   or cost map every time, an incremental update from the server is much
   more efficient.  The goals are to reduce the load on the ALTO Client
   and Server by efficiently transmitting only the updated portions of
   those maps, and to provide timely updates to clients.

   This draft uses the JSON Merge Patch message format [RFC7386] to
   encode the incremental update messages for network maps and cost
   maps, and uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the transport mechanism to
   deliver those updates to clients.

2.  Incremental Update Message Format

2.1.  JSON Merge Patch

   [RFC7386] defines JSON Merge Patch format and transport, which
   enables applications to update the server resources via the PATCH
   method [RFC5789] of HTTP.  This draft adopts the format of the Merge
   Patch messages to encode our incremental updates objects, but uses a
   different transport mechanism.

   The process of applying a Merge Patch is defined by the following
   algorithm, as specified in [RFC7386]:

     define MergePatch(Target, Patch) {
       if Patch is an Object {
         if Target is not an Object {
           Target = {} # Ignore the contents and
                       # set it to an empty Object
         }
         for each Name/Value pair in Patch {
           if Value is null {
             if Name exists in Target {
               remove the Name/Value pair from Target
             }
           } else {
             Target[Name] = MergePatch(Target[Name], Value)
           }
         }
         return Target
       } else {
         return Patch
       }
     }

   Note that null as the value of a name/value pair will remove the pair
   with "name" in the original JSON document.

2.2.  JSON Merge Patch Applied to Network Map Messages

   Section 11.2.1.6 of [RFC7285] defines the format of a Network Map
   message.  Here is a simple example:

     {
       "meta" : {
         "vtag": {
           "resource-id": "my-default-network-map",
           "tag": "da65eca2eb7a10ce8b059740b0b2e3f8eb1d4785"
         }
       },
       "network-map" : {
         "PID1" : {
           "ipv4" : [
             "192.0.2.0/24",
             "198.51.100.0/25"
           ]
         },
         "PID2" : {
           "ipv4" : [ "198.51.100.128/25" ]
         },
         "PID3" : {
           "ipv4" : [ "0.0.0.0/0" ],
           "ipv6" : [ "::/0" ]
         }
       }
     }

   When applied to that message, the following Merge Patch update
   message adds the ipv6 prefix "2000::/3" to "PID1", deletes "PID2",
   and assigns a new "tag" to the Network Map:

     {
       "meta" : {
         "vtag" : {
           "tag" : "ae1014b1938bce40b0b28eb1d4785ac42231tus"
         }
       },
       "network-map": {
         "PID1" : {
           "ipv6" : [ "2000::/3" ]
         },
         "PID2" : null
       }
     }

   Here is the updated Network Map:

       "meta" : {

           "resource-id": "my-default-network-map",
           "tag": "ae1014b1938bce40b0b28eb1d4785ac42231tus"
         }
       },
       "network-map" : {
         "PID1" : {
           "ipv4" : [
             "192.0.2.0/24",
             "198.51.100.0/25"
           ],
           "ipv6" : [ "2000::/3" ]
         },
         "PID3" : {
           "ipv4" : [ "0.0.0.0/0" ],
           "ipv6" : [  "::/0" ]
         }
       }
     }

2.3.  JSON Merge Patch Applied to Cost Map Messages

   Section 11.2.3.6 of [RFC7285] defines the format of a Cost Map
   message.  Here is a simple example:

     {
       "meta" : {
         "dependent-vtags" : [
           {"resource-id": "my-default-network-map",
            "tag": "3ee2cb7e8d63d9fab71b9b34cbf764436315542e"
           }
         ],
         "cost-type" : {"cost-mode"  : "numerical",
                        "cost-metric": "routingcost"
         }
       },
       "cost-map" : {
         "PID1": { "PID1": 1,  "PID2": 5,  "PID3": 10 },
         "PID2": { "PID1": 5,  "PID2": 1,  "PID3": 15 },
         "PID3": { "PID1": 20, "PID2": 15  }
       }
     }

   The following Merge Patch message updates that cost map so that (1)
   PID1->PID2 is 9 instead of 5; (2) PID3->PID1 is no longer available;
   and (3) PID3->PID3 is now 1:

     {
       "cost-map" : {
         "PID1" : { "PID2" : 9 },
         "PID3" : { "PID1" : null, "PID3" : 1 }
       }
     }

   Here is the updated Cost Map:

     {
       "meta" : {
         "dependent-vtags" : [
           {"resource-id": "my-default-network-map",
            "tag": "3ee2cb7e8d63d9fab71b9b34cbf764436315542e"
           }
         ],
         "cost-type" : {"cost-mode"  : "numerical",
                        "cost-metric": "routingcost"
         }
       },
       "cost-map" : {
         "PID1": { "PID1": 1,  "PID2": 9,  "PID3": 10 },
         "PID2": { "PID1": 5,  "PID2": 1,  "PID3": 15 },
         "PID3": { "PID1": 20,             "PID3": 1  }
       }
     }

3.  Server-Sent Events

3.1.  Overview of SSEs

   Server-Sent Events [SSE] enable a server to send new data to a client
   by pushing messages to the client.  To summarize the protocol, the
   client establishes an HTTP connection to the server, and keeps the
   connection open.  The server continually sends messages.  Messages
   are delimited by two new-lines (this is a slight simplification of
   the full specification), and contain three fields: an event type, an
   id, and data.  All fields are strings.  The data field may contain
   new-lines; the other fields cannot.  The event type and id fields are
   optional.

   Here is a sample SSE stream, starting with the client request.  The
   server sends three events and then closes the stream.

     event: start
     data: hello there

     event: middle
     data: let's chat some more ... and more ...

     event: end
     data: good bye

3.2.  ALTO SSE Update Messages

   In our events, the data field is a JSON message; specifically, a
   Network Map, a Cost Map, or a Merge Patch to apply to a Network or
   Cost Map.  Our event types have two sub-fields: the media-type of the
   JSON message in the data field, and the resource-id of the ALTO
   Network Map or Cost Map resource.  The media-types are "application/
   alto-networkmap+json" for Network Map messages, "application/alto-
   costmap+json" for Cost Map messages, or "application/merge-
   patch+json" for Merge Patch messages.  The first two types are
   defined by [RFC7285], and the last is defined by [RFC7285].

   We do not use the SSE id field.

   Because commas (character code 0x2c) are not allowed in media-type
   names, we encode the event type sub-fields as

         media-type , resource-id

   Here examples of ALTO update events.

     event: application/alto-networkmap+json,my-network-map
     data: { ... full Network Map message ... }

     event: application/alto-costmap+json,my-routingcost-map
     data: { ... full Cost Map message ... }

     event: application/merge-patch+json,my-routingcost-map
     data: { ... Merge Patch update for Cost Map ... }

Internet-Draft          ALTO Incremental Updates            October 2014


3.3.  Keep-Alive Messages

   An SSE event with an empty event type is a keep-alive message.  An
   ALTO Server MAY send keep-alive messages as needed.  An ALTO Client
   MUST ignore any keep-alive messages.

4.  Update Stream Service

   An Update Stream Service returns a stream of SSE messages, as defined
   in Section 3.2.

4.1.  Media Type

   The media type of an ALTO Update Stream resource is "text/event-
   stream".

4.2.  HTTP Method

   An ALTO Update Stream resource is requested using the HTTP GET
   method.

4.3.  Accept Input Parameters

   None.

4.4.  Capabilities

   The capabilities are defined by an object of type
   UpdateStreamCapabilities:

     object {
       JSONString events<1..*>;
     } UpdateEventStreamCapabilities;

   The strings in the array are the event types (see Section 3.2) sent
   by this Update Stream.

   If an Update Event Service's event capability list has an event with
   a media-type of "text/merge-patch+json" for a given Network Map
   resource-id, the event capability list MUST also have an event with
   media-type "application/alto-networkmap+json" for that resource-id.
   Similarly, if an Update Event Service's event capability list has an
   event with a media-type of "text/merge-patch+json" for a given Cost
   Map resource-id, the event capability list MUST also have an event
   with media-type "application/alto-costmap+json" for that resource-id.

Internet-Draft          ALTO Incremental Updates            October 2014


4.5.  Uses

   An array with the resource-ids of the resources for which this stream
   sends updates.  This array MUST contain the resource-ids of every
   event type in the "events" capability.

4.6.  Event Order Requirements

   There are several requirements on the order in which an ALTO Server
   sends SSE Update messages on the event stream:

   o  For any given resource-id, the ALTO Server MUST send a full-map
      update event (media-type "application/alto-networkmap+json" or
      "application/alto-costmap+json") before the first Merge Patch
      event (media-type "application/merge-patch+json") for that
      resource-id.

   o  The ALTO Server SHOULD send full-map update events for all
      resource-ids covered by this Update Stream resource as soon as
      possible after the client initiates the connection.

   o  When a Network Map changes, the ALTO Server MUST send an update
      event for that Network Map before sending the update events for
      any Cost Maps that depend on that Network Map.

   o  When a Network Map changes, the ALTO Server SHOULD send update
      events for all Cost Maps that depend on that Network Map as soon
      as possible after sending the update event for the Network Map.

4.7.  Response

   Here is an example of a client's request and the server's immediate
   response, using the Update Stream resource "my-routingcost-update-
   stream" defined in the IRD in Section 6.  This assumes the Update
   Stream service sends updates for a Network Map with resource-id "my-
   network-map" and an associated Cost Map with resource-id "my-
   routingcost-map":

     GET /updates/routingcost HTTP/1.1
     Host: alto.example.com
     Accept: text/event-stream

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Connection: keep-alive
     Content-Type: text/event-stream

     event: application/alto-networkmap+json,my-network-map
     data: { ... full Network Map message ... }

     event: application/alto-costmap+json,my-routingcost-map
     data: { ... full Cost Map message ... }

   After sending those two events immediately, the ALTO Server will send
   additional events as the maps change.  For example, the following
   represents a small change to the Cost Map:

     event: {"resource-id":"my-routingcost-map",
         "media-type":"application/merge-patch+json"}
     data: {"cost-map": {"PID1" : {"PID2" : 9}}}

   If a major change to the Network Map occurs, the ALTO Server MAY
   choose to send full Network and Cost Map messages rather than Merge
   Patch messages:

     event: application/alto-networkmap+json,my-network-map
     data: { ... full Network Map message ... }

     event: application/alto-costmap+json,my-routingcost-map
     data: { ... full Cost Map message ... }

4.8.  Client Actions When Receiving Update Messages

   In general, when a client receives a full-map update message for a
   resource, the client should replace the current version with the new
   version.  When a client receives a Merge Patch update message for a
   resource, the client should apply those patches to the current
   version of the resource.

   However, because Cost Maps depend on Network Maps, an ALTO Client
   MUST NOT use the previous Cost Map(s) with the updated Network Map.
   There are at least two ways a client may do that.

   One approach is for the ALTO Client to save the Network Map update
   message in a buffer, and continue to use the previous Network Map,
   and the associated Cost Maps, until the client receives the update

   messages for all of those Cost Maps.  The client then applies all
   Network and Cost Map updates atomically.

   Alternatively, the client MAY update the Network Map immediately.  In
   this case, the client MUST mark all dependent Cost Maps as
   temporarily invalid, and MUST NOT use them.  When the client receives
   a Cost Map update message with the new Network Map version tag, the
   client updates that Cost Map and marks it as valid.  Note that the
   client MUST NOT delete the Cost Maps, because the server may send
   Merge Patch update messages.

   The ALTO Server SHOULD send Cost Map updates in a timely fashion.
   However, if the client does not receive the expected Cost Map
   updates, the client MUST close the Update Stream connection, discard
   the Cost Maps, and reestablish the Update Stream.  If the client uses
   the Filtered Update Stream service, the client MAY retain the last
   received Network Map, and give that map's version tag when requesting
   the new Update Stream.  In this case, if that version is still
   current, the ALTO Server will not re-send the Network Map.

   Although inefficient, this recovery method is simple and reliable.

5.  Filtered Update Stream Service

   The Filtered Update Stream service is similar to the Update Stream
   service, except that the client can select the types of update
   events.  Specifically, except as noted below, the Filtered Update
   Stream service is identical to the Update Stream service (Section 4).

5.1.  HTTP Method

   A Filtered ALTO Update Stream resource is requested using the HTTP
   POST method.

5.2.  Accept Input Parameters

   An ALTO Client supplies filtering parameters by specifying media type
   "application/alto-updatestreamfilter+json" with HTTP POST body
   containing a JSON object of type ReqFilteredUpdateStream, where:

     object {
       [UpdateEventType events<1..*>;]
       [VersionTag      vtags<1..*>;]
     } ReqFilteredUpdateStream;

   The "events" field gives the types of the events the ALTO Client
   wishes to receive.  These events MUST be a subset of the "events"
   capability of this resource.  If the "events" list is omitted, the

   ALTO Server MUST send all event types in the "events" capability of
   this resource.

   The "vtags" field gives the version tags, as defined in Section 10.3
   of [RFC7285], for any resources which the client already has.  If
   those versions are still current, the server SHOULD NOT send the full
   version of that resource at startup.

   If a client requests Merge Patch update events for a given resource-
   id, the client MUST also request the corresponding full map update
   events for that resource-id.

   If a client requests the full map update event for given resource-id,
   but does not request the Merge Patch update event for that resource-
   id, then the ALTO Server MUST send full map update events whenever
   the map changes.  For Network Map resources, the ALTO Server SHOULD
   send the full map as soon as it would have sent the Merge Patch
   event.  For Cost Map resources, the ALTO Server MAY delay sending the
   full Cost Map until more changes are available.

5.3.  Response

   Here is an example of a client's request and the server's immediate
   response, using the Filtered Update Stream resource "my-allcosts-
   update-stream" defined in the IRD in Section 6.  The client requests
   updates for the Network Map and the "routingcost" Cost Map, but does
   not want updates for the "hopcount" Cost Map.  The "vtags" field
   gives the client's version of the Network Map.  Because that version
   is still current, the server does not send the full Network Map
   update event at the beginning of the stream:

     Host: alto.example.com
     Accept: text/event-stream
     Content-Type: application/alto-updatestreamfilter+json
     Content-Length: ###

     { "events": [
         "application/alto-networkmap+json,my-network-map",

         "application/merge-patch+json,my-routingcost-map"

     Connection: keep-alive
     Content-Type: text/event-stream

     event: application/alto-costmap+json,my-routingcost-map
     data: { ... full Cost Map message ... }

   After that, the ALTO Server sends updates for the Network Map and
   "routingcost" Cost Map as they become available.

6.  IRD Example

   Here is an example of an IRD that offers both regular and Filtered
   Update Stream services.  The unfiltered Update Stream provides
   updates for the Network Map and "routingcost" Cost Map.  The Filtered
   Update Stream provides update to both those maps, plus the "hopcount"
   Cost Map.

7.  Design Decisions and Discussion

7.1.  Resources Which Can Be Incrementally Updated

   We only define Incremental Update for GET-mode full map resources
   such as the full Network Map and full Cost Map services.  In
   particular, this draft does not attempt to define incremental update
   for the Endpoint Cost or Endpoint Property services, because we do
   not believe incremental update would be useful for those services.
   For example, consider an Endpoint Cost client that uses ALTO to
   select the server from which to download a movie.  The client issues
   an Endpoint Cost request to get the costs from (say) 10 servers to
   the client, and picks the lowest cost server.  If the client
   downloads the movie in chunks, the client will want to periodically
   reevaluate the costs to see if it should switch to a different
   server.  But an Endpoint Cost query takes at most a few thousand
   bytes, and it will be at least a few minutes between queries.  Given
   those statistics, it hardly seems worthwhile to create an update
   stream.  It is just as efficient, and much simpler, to repeat the
   Endpoint Cost request as needed.

7.2.  Not Allowing Stream Restart

   If an update stream is closed accidentally, when the client
   reconnects, the server must resend the full maps.  This is clearly
   inefficient.  To avoid that inefficiency, the SSE specification
   allows a server to assign an id to each event.  When a client
   reconnects, the client can present the id of the last successfully
   received event, and the server restarts with the next event.

   However, that mechanism adds a lot of complication.  The server would
   have to save SSE messages in a buffer, in case clients reconnect.
   But that mechanism will never be perfect: if the client waits too
   long to reconnect, or if the client's last id is bogus, then the
   server will have to resend the complete maps anyway.

   In short, using event ids to avoid resending the full map adds a lot
   of complication to avoid a situation which is hopefully very rare.
   Hence we decided to keep it simple.

   The Filtered Update Stream service does allow the client to specify
   the vtag of the last received Network Map, and if that is still
   current, the server can avoid retransmitting the Network Map.

7.3.  Is Incremental Update Useful for Network Maps?

   It is not clear whether incremental update (that is, Merge Patch
   update) is useful for Network Maps.  For minor changes, such as
   moving a prefix from one PID to another, it might be useful.  But
   more involved changes to the Network Map are likely to be "flag
   days": they represent a completely new Network Map, rather than a
   simple, well-defined change.

   This is not to say that Network Map updates are not useful.  Clearly
   Network Maps will change, and update events are necessary to inform
   clients of the new map.  But we expect most Network Map updates will
   be full updates with full Network Map message, rather than
   incremental Merge Patch updates.

   Note that while we allow a server to use Merge Patch on Network Maps,
   we do not require the server to do so.

8.  Security Considerations

   Allowing persistent update stream connections does enable a new class
   of Denial-of-Service attacks.  An ALTO Server MAY choose to limit the
   number of active streams, and reject new requests when that threshold
   is reached.  In this case the server should return the HTTP status
   "503 Service Unavailable".

   Alternatively an ALTO Server MAY return the HTTP status "307
   Temporary Redirect" to redirect the client to another ALTO Server
   which can better handle a large number of update streams.

   This extension does not introduce any privacy issues not already
   present in the ALTO protocol.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This draft defines a new media-type, "application/alto-
   updatestreamfilter+json", as described in Section 5.2.  That type
   must be registered with IANA.

   All other media-types used in this document have already been
   registered, either for ALTO or JSON Merge Patch.
